A candidate without a ballot-listed affiliation to either the Democrat or Republican Parties will be considered a member of one of these parties based on the party that they most recently expressed their intent to caucus with at the time the 2024 House, Senate and Presidency are conclusively called by this market's resolution sources.\n\nIf control of the House is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will resolve according to the party affiliation of the first Speaker of the US House who is selected following the 2024 US general election.\n\nIf control of the Senate is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will resolve according to the party affiliation of the first Majority Leader of the US Senate who is selected following the 2024 US general election.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the Associated Press, Fox News, and NBC. This market will resolve once all three sources have conclusively called winners of the House, Senate, and Presidency in the 2024 US general election. If all three sources do not achieve consensus in calling the relevant races for this market, it will resolve based on the official certification.",

Valid votes are defined as votes cast for either Sergio Massa or Javier Milei, excluding votes that are blank, null, etc. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of valid votes each candidate receives by the sum of all valid votes received by both candidates.\n\nFor example, if Massa receives 53% of the valid votes, and Milei receives 47% of the valid votes, the difference will be found by subtracting 47 from 53, thus the Massa margin of victory in this case would equal 6 (Massa% - Milei% = Margin of Victory).\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the Argentine government (e.g. https:\/\/www.argentina.gob.ar\/interior\/dine).",

This was the largest series of such resignations in British history, and many previously supportive MPs called for Johnson to resign. This brought about a government crisis. As a result, On 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson, the Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party since 2019, announced his resignation as party leader, but plans to remain as prime minister until a successor is chosen.\n\nThe 2022 Conservative Party leadership election to determine Boris Johnson's successor as Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party is due to start on July 13, 2022, with final results expected on September 5, 2022.\n\n---\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Kemi Badenoch wins the election to become the Conservative Party leader succeeding Boris Johnson.

The 2022 Italian General Election is scheduled to take place no later than September 25, 2022. According to available polling as of the publication of this market, the two most popular parties in the run up to the 2022 Italian General Election are the Partito Democratico (Democratic Party, or PD) and the Fratelli D'Italia (Brothers of Italy). These two parties belong to opposing coalitions.\n\nIf Partito Democratico (PD) is allotted a greater number of seats in the Italian Chamber of Deputies than Fratelli D'Italia (FDI) as a result of the 2022 Italian General Election, this market will resolve to \"Partito Democratico\". If Fratelli D'Italia is allotted a greater number of seats, this market will resolve to \"Fratelli D'Italia\". If Partido Democratico and Fratelli D'Italia are allotted the same number of seats, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nOnly seats won by the individual parties mentioned in this market will count toward the resolution of this market. Seats won by members of each party's coalition that were not won by the parties themselves (PD and FDI) will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nIf the election for the 19th Italian Legislature does not occur before January 1, 2023, 12:00:00 AM ET, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the Italian Government (https:\/\/elezioni.interno.gov.it\/, etc), however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",

This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Adams is the winner of the Democratic primary for Mayor of New York City, and \"No\" otherwise. The primary is currently scheduled for June 22, 2021. In the event that the primary is not held on that date, the resolution of this market will be delayed until the primary takes place. If no primary is held in 2021, this market will resolve to \"No\". The resolution source for this market will be any official CNN publication that declares Eric Adams the primary winner. In the event of conflicting sources between CNN and WSJ (https:\/\/www.wsj.com) or Associated Press (https:\/\/apnews.com\/), the market will only be resolved once there is a definitive winner.

The Defense of Marriage Act is a bill former President Clinton signed into law in 1996 that recognized marriage as \u201conly a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife\u201d and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states.\n\nIn July 2022, the Respect for Marriage Act was reintroduced to Congress with revisions, including protections for interracial marriages. The Act passed the House in a bipartisan vote (267-157) on July 19, 2022. \n\n----\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if \"The Respect for Marriage Act\" (H.R.8404) passes the U.S. Senate on the first vote before the resolution date, December 31, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET.

The election is scheduled to take place on August 3, 2021. The upper bound for this market is +8 (Turner) and the lower bound is -8 (Brown). The percentages of popular vote will be calculated by dividing the number of votes won by each candidate by the total number of votes for all ballot-listed candidates. Officially reported votes and unrounded percentages will be used. The margin of victory will then be calculated as Turner (percentage) minus Brown (percentage). For instance if Turner got 47.13% of the vote and Brown got 51.14% of the vote, then the margin of victory would be 47.13-51.14 = -4.01. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the margin of victory. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

    "description":"In Response to Trader Inquiry: The result that is relevant for this market is the number of seats Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party wins, regardless of what the name of his party is.\n\nFrench legislative elections are scheduled for June 12 and 19, 2022. Elections for the National Assembly, which is the lower house of France's bicameral parliament, are conducted every 5 years over 2 rounds of voting. A single representative is chosen for each of 577 constituencies, and the sum total of representatives makes up the National Assembly. \n\nFollowing Emmanuel Macron's reelection to the French Presidency, his party \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" (often abbreviated to \"LREM\" or \"En Marche!\") changed its name to \"Renaissance\" in an effort to rebrand itself.\n\nGiven there are 577 seats in the National assembly, winning 289 seats or more qualifies as winning an \"outright majority\".\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Emmanuel Macron's political party \"Renaissance\" (formerly \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\") wins 289 or more seats in the National Assembly during the 2022 French Legislative Election. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf voting on the 2022 French Legislative Election does not occur by October 1, 2022, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThis market's settlement will be based solely on the numbers for the \"Renaissance\" party, not the coalition of which it is part.\n\nThe settlement of this market will be based on numbers released after any second rounds of voting if they occur. \n\nThe figures for the number of seats each party received will primarily be derived from the table expressing data from the election on the official election results page hosted by the French Ministry of the Interior (https:\/\/www.elections.interieur.gouv.fr\/resultats\/resultats-en-direct), however a consensus of credible reporting may be used.",
