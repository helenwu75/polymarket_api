If the AP declares a winner while Kamala Harris has already begun delivering a speech, the entirety of the speech will be considered for this market including terms mentioned prior to the AP\u2019s announcement.\n\nA speech is defined as any statement delivered on camera which is three minutes (180 seconds) or greater in length. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Harris says \"Trump\" during their speech. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization\/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nCompound words will count as long as \"Trump\" is part of the compound word and references the meaning which refers to the person Donald Trump.\n\nIf the AP does not declare a winner by November 30, 2024 ET, or Kamala Harris does not give a speech between the AP declaring a winner and November 30, 2024 ET, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe resolution source will be the video of the speech.",

Any coalitions made with other parties or elected deputies after the results of the election are reported will not be considered for this market. \n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information published through the website of the French Ministry of the Interior (https:\/\/www.resultats-elections.interieur.gouv.fr\/legislatives2024\/) , however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\n",

If the AP declares a winner while Kamala Harris has already begun delivering a speech, the entirety of the speech will be considered for this market including terms mentioned prior to the AP\u2019s announcement.\n\nA speech is defined as any statement delivered on camera which is three minutes (180 seconds) or greater in length. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Harris says \"Putin\" during their speech. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization\/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nCompound words will count as long as \"Putin\"  is part of the compound word and references the meaning which refers to the world leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nIf the AP does not declare a winner by November 30, 2024 ET, or Kamala Harris does not give a speech between the AP declaring a winner and November 30, 2024 ET, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe resolution source will be the video of the speech.",

This was the largest series of such resignations in British history, and many previously supportive MPs called for Johnson to resign. This brought about a government crisis. As a result, On 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson, the Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party since 2019, announced his resignation as party leader, but plans to remain as prime minister until a successor is chosen.\n\nThe 2022 Conservative Party leadership election to determine Boris Johnson's successor as Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party is due to start on July 13, 2022, with final results expected on September 5, 2022.\n\n---\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Tom Tugendhat wins the election to become the Conservative Party leader succeeding Boris Johnson. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution of this market will be based on the first official announcement of the next permanent Conservative Party leader after Boris Johnson, as chosen by a Conservative Party leadership contest. The primary resolution source will be official government sources reporting the result of the election; however, a consensus of credible media sources will also suffice.\n\nIf the successor to Boris Johnson is not known by December 31, 2022, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThis market may only resolve to \"No\" once Tom Tugendhat announces he is no longer in contention for head of the Conservative Party, or the Conservative party announces Tom Tugendhat is no longer in contention for head of the Conservative Party, or election results eliminate Tom Tugendhat from the running for leader of the Conservative Party, or the next leader of the Conservative Party after Boris Johnson is officially selected and it is not Tom Tugendhat.\n\nPlease note that acting leaderships do not count toward the resolution of this market.",

Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization\/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nCompound words will count as long as \"Trudeau\" is part of the compound word and references the meaning which refers to the person Justin Trudeau. \n\nIf the press conference is permanently canceled or delayed beyond January 8, 2025, 11:59 PM ET this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be the video of the speech.",
