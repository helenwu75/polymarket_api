As a result, On 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson, the Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party since 2019, announced his resignation as party leader, but plans to remain as prime minister until a successor is chosen.\n\nThe 2022 Conservative Party leadership election to determine Boris Johnson's successor as Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party is due to start on July 13, 2022, with final results expected on September 5, 2022.\n\n---\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Rishi Sunak wins the election to become the Conservative Party leader succeeding Boris Johnson.

This was the largest series of such resignations in British history, and many previously supportive MPs called for Johnson to resign. This brought about a government crisis. As a result, On 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson, the Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party since 2019, announced his resignation as party leader, but plans to remain as prime minister until a successor is chosen.\n\nThe 2022 Conservative Party leadership election to determine Boris Johnson's successor as Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party is due to start on July 13, 2022, with final results expected on September 5, 2022.\n\nThis is a market group on who will replace Boris Johnson as head of the Conservative Party.",
